EKhelper
---------------------------
A Python-based app that should make your Emerald Kaizo experience a (little) bit easier.

What it does
---------------------------
Analyzes the target trainer pokemon versus the pokemon in your party & box.
Lists the best pokemon on your team against each target pokemon, both dealing damage against foe (top row) and taking damage from foe (bottom row).

How it works
---------------------------
You will need the EK Mastersheet.txt (taken from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yfYLvI5m1QMApy55VBSrJT2C0P_HGrDM) unedited, and enter the line number of the name of the trainer you are interested in, on the command-line interface. A window will appear with the results. Highly recommend opening the master sheet with a text editor program that includes line numbers!

Data
---------------------------
Data has been curated for Emerald Kaizo specifically (this includes move power, pp, accuracy changes and pokemon base stats). See data/gen3moves.xlsx and data/pokemon.xlsx if you are interested in these datasets specifically.
